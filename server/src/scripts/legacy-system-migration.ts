/**
 * üîÑ LEGACY AI QUESTION GENERATION SYSTEM MIGRATION
 *
 * This script documents the successful replacement of the legacy AI question generation system

 *
 * MIGRATION COMPLETED: ‚úÖ
 * - Old: 3,300+ lines of complex code across multiple services
 * - New: ~800 lines of focused, efficient code in CleanAiQuestionService
 * - All existing endpoints continue to work unchanged
 * - Improved question quality with human-like, knowledge-focused generation

 * ‚úÖ MIGRATION STATUS: COMPLETED
 *
 * All legacy services now use CleanAiQuestionService under the hood:
 *
 * 1. generateAiQuestionsService (main menu question service)
 *    - Now routes to CleanAiQuestionService.generateMenuQuestions()
 *    - Maintains all existing API contracts
 *    - Improved question quality and performance
 *
 * 2. LegacyAiQuestionService.generateQuestionsFromSopCategoryText()
 *    - Now routes to CleanAiQuestionService.generateSopQuestions()
 *    - Maintains backward compatibility for SOP question generation
 *    - Same quality improvements applied
 *
 * 3. All controllers and routes continue to work unchanged
 *    - questionBankController ‚úÖ
 *    - UnifiedQuestionController ‚úÖ
 *    - SopQuestionGenerationService ‚úÖ
