Perfect with richer seafood offerings. 2020 Orange Gold, Gérard Bertrand | Languedoc-Roussillon, France 50 The perfect introduction to the world of Orange wine. ‘Orange Gold’ is produced using an ancestral winemaking method. The grapes are fermented as whole clusters and maceration takes place with stalks and skins, resulting in a remarkable orange colour and subtle tannins.

Ancient vines grown on volcanic soil with extreme exposure to the Aegean Sea helps give these wines a unique character. Yiannis from Gaia has taken this a stage further by macerating on the skins for seven days, and then ageing in clay spheres for four years. This results in a richly textured orange wine of dried tropical fruit and honeycomb that still holds onto a dry mineral finish.
