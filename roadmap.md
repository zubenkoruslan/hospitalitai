# Hospitality Training Platform Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development for the platform, focusing on feature enhancements, user interface improvements, and scalability.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Functionality (e.g., Next 3 Months)

**Goal:** Launch a minimum viable product (MVP) with essential training capabilities.

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - [ ] User authentication (Sign up, Login, Password Reset). _(Assumed partially implemented via auth middleware, but not explicitly worked on)_
  - [x] Basic user roles (Admin/Restaurant, Trainee/Staff).
  - [x] Course creation and management (Text-based content, simple structure - focused on Quizzes).
  - [x] Basic text-based quizzes and assessments.
  - [x] User dashboard showing assigned courses/quizzes.
- **UI Improvements:**
  - [ ] Develop refined wireframes and interactive prototypes focusing on intuitive workflows.
  - [x] Implement a minimalist, elegant UI emphasizing clarity, high-quality typography, and ample white space. _(Existing UI foundation)_
  - [ ] Ensure seamless responsiveness and visual consistency across all Apple device sizes (iPhone, iPad, Mac).
- **Scalability & Infrastructure:**
  - [ ] Set up initial cloud hosting environment (e.g., AWS EC2, Heroku).
  - [x] Configure a database (MongoDB used, not PostgreSQL as initially planned).
  - [x] Implement basic logging and monitoring (`console.log` used).
  - [x] Version control setup (Git).

## Phase 2: Enhancements & User Experience (e.g., Months 3-6)

**Goal:** Improve learning engagement and refine the user interface.

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - [ ] **Multimedia Quizzes:** Integrate image, audio, and video options into quizzes.
  - [x] Course progress tracking and visualization (Implemented via Quiz Results: status, score, history).
  - [x] Basic reporting for admins (e.g., course completion rates - Implemented via Restaurant Staff Results view).
  - [x] Notifications system (e.g., new course assignments, completed training).
- **UI Improvements:**
  - [x] **Refine UI with Tailwind CSS:** Enhance the UI using Tailwind, focusing on creating a polished, pixel-perfect interface. _(Ongoing process, Tailwind is in use)_
  - [ ] Conduct usability testing sessions to ensure intuitiveness and gather qualitative feedback.
  - [ ] Streamline navigation for effortless discoverability, adopting familiar iOS/macOS patterns where appropriate.
- **Scalability & Infrastructure:**
  - [x] Optimize database queries and indexing (Added indexes for Quiz, Notification models).
  - [ ] Introduce background job processing for tasks like sending notifications.
  - [ ] Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

## Phase 3: Rich Features & Scalability Preparation (e.g., Months 6-9)

**Goal:** Add advanced training features and prepare the application for growth.

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Interactive training modules (e.g., simulations, scenario-based learning).
  - [ ] Certification management and generation upon course completion.
  - [ ] User profiles and achievements/badges.
  - [ ] Basic discussion forums or Q&A sections per course.
- **UI Improvements:**
  - [ ] Achieve a cohesive and premium look-and-feel fully leveraging **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring meticulous attention to detail.
  - [ ] Ensure adherence to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) and WCAG standards for accessibility.
  - [ ] Optimize touch interactions and layout specifically for iOS and iPadOS, aiming for a native-app feel.
- **Scalability & Infrastructure:**
  - [ ] **Dockerization:** Containerize the application components using Docker.
  - [ ] Implement load balancing for handling increased traffic.
  - [ ] Explore options for Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets and media.
  - [ ] Enhance monitoring and alerting.

## Phase 4: Advanced Scalability & Future Growth (e.g., Months 9-12+)

**Goal:** Ensure long-term scalability, performance, and introduce cutting-edge features.

- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Gamification elements (points, leaderboards).
  - [ ] Personalized learning paths based on user roles or performance.
  - [ ] Integration capabilities with external HR/LMS systems (API development).
  - [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard.
- **UI Improvements:**
  - [ ] Focus on micro-interactions and delightful details that enhance the user experience and provide clear feedback.
  - [ ] Optimize performance for lightning-fast responsiveness, mirroring native app speed (e.g., code splitting, asset optimization).
  - [ ] Continuously iterate on the design based on user feedback and Apple's evolving design language and platform capabilities.
- **Scalability & Infrastructure:**
  - [ ] Implement container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
  - [ ] Explore microservices architecture for key components if needed.
  - [ ] Implement robust backup and disaster recovery strategies.
  - [ ] Advanced security auditing and penetration testing.
