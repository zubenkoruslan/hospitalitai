# Frontend Refactoring Progress

This document tracks the progress of the frontend refactoring for the HospitalityAI project.

## Phase 1: Backend (Server-Side) Analysis & Refactoring

- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Summary:** Standardized `restaurantId` refs, cleaned models (e.g., `QuestionBankModel`), refactored services for `restaurantId` consistency and cascade deletions with transactions (e.g., `staffService.deleteStaffMember`, `menuService.deleteMenu`), updated `authService` for transactional registration, moved interfaces to type files, applied validation middlewares to routes, and cleaned up `server.ts` (e.g., enabling `morgan`, `rateLimit`). `quizResultService.submitAnswers` and its route were removed as legacy. `quizAttemptRoutes.ts` was merged into `quiz.ts`.

## Phase 2: Frontend (Client-Side) Analysis & Refactoring

### Completed Tasks

1.  **Part 2.1: API Services & Types (`client/src/services/api.ts`, `client/src/types/`)**

    - Migrated inline types from `api.ts` to dedicated files in `client/src/types/`.
    - Updated types to reflect backend changes.
    - Refactored `api.ts` functions (renaming, added `getQuizCount`, `deleteQuiz`).
    - Addressed persistent tooling issues with `edit_file` on `api.ts` through iterative fixes.

2.  **`main.tsx` & `App.tsx`**

    - Removed `App.css` import from `App.tsx`.

3.  **Part 2.2: Contexts and Auth Flow**

    - `AuthContext.tsx`: Refactored `DecodedToken`, updated `user` state type, `useEffect` now fetches full user details, `login` uses `loginService`. Exported `AuthContext` object.
    - `ValidationContext.tsx`: Exported `ValidationContext` object and `ValidationFunctions` interface.
    - `ProtectedRoute.tsx`: Confirmed alignment with `AuthContext`.

4.  **Part 2.3: Page Components (`client/src/pages/`)**

    - Refactored multiple page components and associated custom hooks to use updated service functions, corrected type imports, and removed direct `api` imports. This included:
      - `StaffDashboard.tsx`
      - `QuizAndBankManagementPage.tsx`
      - `QuizTakingPage.tsx`
      - `RestaurantDashboard.tsx` (and its hooks `useStaffSummary.ts`, `useQuizCount.ts`, `useMenus.ts`)
      - `StaffManagement.tsx`
      - `MenusPage.tsx`
      - `MenuItemsPage.tsx` (and its hook `useMenuData.ts`)
      - `StaffDetails.tsx` (and its hook `useStaffDetails.ts`)
      - `QuestionBankListPage.tsx` (and its hook `useQuestionBanks.ts`)
      - `QuestionBankDetailPage.tsx`
      - `QuestionBankEditPage.tsx` (significant refactor to use `useQuestionBanks` hook)
      - `RestaurantStaffResultsPage.tsx`

### To Do (Frontend - Phase 2 Continued)

The next steps involve reviewing and refactoring components in the following directories, including creating test files and ensuring alignment with project conventions and type safety:

1.  **Part 2.12: Final Review and Cleanup**
    - Review any remaining uninspected files in `client/src/` (e.g., `hooks/`, `utils/` if not covered by component refactors).
    - Perform a final check for type consistency across the client-side codebase.
    - Ensure all new components have corresponding test files with good coverage.
    - Address any outstanding TODOs or minor issues identified during the refactoring.

### Recurring Issues/Themes Encountered & Mitigated

- **Tooling Limitation with `edit_file` on `api.ts`**: A persistent issue where the tool failed to correctly apply complex changes to `client/src/services/api.ts`, leading to follow-up linter errors in files consuming those services. Addressed by iterative fixes and careful verification.
- **Test File Creation**: A significant part of the effort involved creating missing `.test.tsx` files for components, aiming for good coverage of rendering, interactions, and edge cases.
- **Mocking**: Child components, services (like `axios` or specific API functions), and contexts (`AuthContext`, `ValidationContext`) were mocked in test files to isolate component logic. This often involved iterative refinement of mocks based on linter errors and type definitions.
- **Type Safety**: Ensuring mock data and component interactions align with TypeScript types defined in `client/src/types/`. This involved reading type definition files and correcting mock data structures.
- **Context Exports**: Ensured that context objects (e.g., `AuthContext`, `ValidationContext`) and necessary types (e.g., `ValidationFunctions`) were exported from their defining files so they could be used in `<Context.Provider>` wrappers in test files or for type annotations.
- **Component Bugs Identified & Fixed**: During test creation and refactoring (e.g., `ManageQuestionsModal.tsx`), bugs in component logic were identified and fixed, improving overall code quality.
