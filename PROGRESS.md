# Project Progress Log

This file tracks the daily progress made on the HospitalityAI project.

## 2024-07-26

- **Backend Refactoring:**
  - Refactored `/login` route handler in `server/src/routes/auth.ts` (added validation, improved error handling).
  - Refactored `server/src/routes/menus.ts`:
    - Added `ensureRestaurantAssociation` middleware.
    - Implemented input validation using `express-validator`.
    - Standardized error handling using `AppError` and `next()`.
  - Refactored `server/src/routes/quiz.ts`:
    - Applied validation (`express-validator`) and standardized error handling (`AppError`, `next()`).
    - Created `server/src/services/quizService.ts` and moved quiz generation, creation, update, deletion, assignment logic into it.
    - Created `server/src/services/quizResultService.ts` and moved quiz submission and staff view logic into it.
    - Updated `quiz.ts` route handlers to delegate logic to the new services.
- **Utilities:**
  - Created `server/src/utils/errorHandler.ts` with `AppError` class and basic `globalErrorHandler`.
  - Created `server/src/middleware/restaurantMiddleware.ts` with `ensureRestaurantAssociation`.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Investigated and resolved persistent TypeScript errors related to `ObjectId` types in services after Mongoose operations (by explicitly adding `_id` type to model interfaces).
