# Hospitality Training Platform: User Flows & Layout Suggestions

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the primary user flows and suggested layouts for a hospitality training platform designed for two main user types:

- **Restaurants (Managers/Owners):** Users who manage menus, create training quizzes, assign them to staff, and track progress.
- **Staff (Employees):** Users who access training materials (menus), take assigned quizzes, and view their results.

The goal is to create an intuitive and efficient experience for both roles.

## 2. Common Flows

### 2.1. Login / Signup

- **Flow:**
  1.  User lands on a landing/login page.
  2.  **Login:** User enters credentials (email/password) -> System validates -> Redirects to appropriate dashboard (Restaurant or Staff).
      - _Error Handling:_ Display clear messages for incorrect credentials. Include a "Forgot Password" link.
  3.  **Signup:** User clicks "Sign Up" -> Selects user type (Restaurant / Staff) -> Fills registration form (Name, Email, Password, Restaurant Name [if Restaurant], potentially an invite code [if Staff]) -> System creates account -> Redirects to appropriate dashboard.
      - _Staff Signup Variation:_ Staff might only be able to sign up using an invite code/link generated by their Restaurant manager.
- **Layout Suggestions:**
  - Clean landing page with clear "Login" and "Sign Up" calls to action.
  - Standard form layout for login (Email, Password fields, Login button, Forgot Password link, link to Signup).
